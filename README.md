# calculator-app
The calculator doesn't rely on any external libraries or frameworks - it's built with pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
I used three main web development languages to create the calculator:

HTML - For the structure of the calculator, including the buttons, display areas, and layout containers.
CSS - For all the styling aspects, including:

The color scheme with both light and dark themes
Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
Visual effects like shadows, transitions, and hover states
Grid layout for the button arrangement


JavaScript - For all the functionality, including:

Handling button clicks and keyboard input
Performing calculations
Managing the calculation history
Implementing theme toggling
Storing user preferences and history using localStorage
Error handling for invalid operations
